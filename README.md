# Email Send using Django

### In this project, you have a form (your message and your email) when you submit the form, it stores in the database but the email will not be sent yet
### When the admin checks the object in the database, admin can write a responde(subject and body) and when saves the changes in the admin pannel, (the email will be sent)
- I have used django signals, ssl, smtlib in this project
